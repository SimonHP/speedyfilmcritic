  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

  <h2>How do you calculate the average score?</h2>
  <p>We collect ratings from IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, and TMDb. Where multiple scores exist, we normalize them to a 0–100 scale and calculate the simple average. This gives you a quick “at-a-glance” number that combines critic and audience perspectives.</p>

  <h2>Why are some movies missing?</h2>
  <p>Our data comes from external APIs (TMDb and OMDb). If a film is not listed in those databases, it may not appear in our results. We continually monitor coverage to improve accuracy.</p>

  <h2>Is Movie Score Aggregator official?</h2>
  <p>No. We are an independent project that uses public data sources. We are not affiliated with IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, or TMDb.</p>

  <h2>Where do streaming availability results come from?</h2>
  <p>Streaming provider data is retrieved from TMDb’s “Watch Providers” API. Availability may vary by region, and currently our app focuses on the UK catalog.</p>

  <h2>Is it free to use?</h2>
  <p>Yes. The service is free for all users. We don’t run ads or charge subscriptions — our goal is to make film discovery quicker and easier.</p>

  <h2>How up to date are the ratings?</h2>
  <p>Every time you search for a film, our app pulls fresh data directly from APIs. This means the ratings and streaming information are always up to date.</p>

  <h2>Why do some scores say N/A?</h2>
  <p>Not every rating source has data for every film. For example, some smaller independent films may not have a Metacritic or Rotten Tomatoes score. In these cases, we display “N/A” instead of leaving the field blank.</p>

  <h2>Can I request a feature?</h2>
